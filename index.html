        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is one of the three main languages used in web development. 
          HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.
          There are two elements that are specially important to understand how the structure of a webpage works:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Head: it contains information or metadata.
           Helps the browser to render the page correctly, the elements cant be seen by the user on the webpage.</li>
         <li>Body: it contains the content that is shown to the user. 
          All the elements that we want to be seen and interacted with by the user must be placed inside this element.</li>
        </ul>

         <p>DOCTYPE html declaration</p>
         <ul>
          <li>This is the HTML document type declaration, this is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document.</li> 
          <li>This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>Tags</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Tags are used to indicate the beggining and the end of an element in your HTML document.</li>
          <li>We use angle brackets to open and close tags.</li>
         </ul>
