        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <br />

        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is one of the three main languages used in web development. 
          HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.
          There are two elements that are specially important to understand how the structure of a webpage works:</p>
        
          <br />
          <ul>
         <li>Head: it contains information or metadata.
           Helps the browser to render the page correctly, the elements cant be seen by the user on the webpage.</li>
         <li>Body: it contains the content that is shown to the user. 
          All the elements that we want to be seen and interacted with by the user must be placed inside this element.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br />
         <p>DOCTYPE html declaration</p>
         <br />
         <ul>
          <li>This is the HTML document type declaration, this is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document.</li> 
          <li>This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.</li>
         </ul>
         <br />

         <p>Tags</p>
         <br />
         <ul>
          <li>Tags are used to indicate the beggining and the end of an element in your HTML document.</li>
          <li>We use angle brackets to open and close tags.</li>
         </ul>
         </section>

        <h2>CSS Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
        <br />

        <p>There are three different ways to style a webpage using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</p>  
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS: It is used to style directly to an element in the HTML file. They are applyed to a specific HTML tag.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS: It contains CSS rules in the head section of the HTML file and they only apply to that page.</li>
          <li>External CSS: This is the most common way to style a webpage because it allowa other developers to make design changes easier.</li>
        </ul>      
        
        <br />
        <p>CSS Rules:</p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes where the rules or declarations will be applied.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components which are the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <p>Everything on CSS has a box around it, there are to categories of boxes: block boxes and inline boxes. Every box is divided into different parts:</p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Content box: it is the area where your content is going to be displayed.</li>
          <li>Padding box: it sits around the content as white space.</li>
          <li>Border box: it wraps the content and any padding.</li>
          <li>Margin box: this is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements.</li>
        </ul>
